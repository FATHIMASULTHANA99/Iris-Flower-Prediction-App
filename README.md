Welcome to the 'Iris Flower Prediction App' â€“ a beginner-level project leveraging the 'Iris' dataset.
Using input parameters such as sepal width, sepal length, petal width, and petal length, our machine learning model, based on the Random Forest Classifier, accurately predicts the type of iris flower.
Explore this project to gain insights into predictive modeling and classification techniques.
